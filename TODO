TODO list for CVS Proxy
-----------------------

* Daemonize
* Accept and parse command line arguments for:
  - Local CVS binary path
  - Local CVS root
  - Remote CVS host, port and path
* Closing connections is broken:
  - When a connection is closed it's deleted from conn_list.  The for
    loop which goes through all the fds to see which ones need attention
    after select will wind up skipping a connection.
  - waitpid() never actually cleans up the zombie'd child.  It's
    probably happening too quickly (but without WHANGUP it wasn't
    reaping the child *at all* in some circumstances).  I think what I
    need to do is move ones I'm trying to delete from the conn_list to a
    del_list and deal with them separately, first closing the socket one
    direction, then waiting 'til the client has closed the socket the
    other direction before being all final about it.
